Level 0: Sample Program

1.	Implement and run the sample program defined in Appendix A..

2.	Observe the number times the LED blinked.
it blinked 4 times 
3.	Explain why the LED only blinked 4 times.

Because blink was at 4 
Level 1: Variable Scope

1.	Comment out (remove) line #24 with the code “int times = value;”

2.	Observe the number times the LED blinked and explain how this is different from before.
Added an extra blink 
3.	Explain how line #24 with the code “int times = value;” changes the program.
the line from aboive will now affect the blink since it now closes and opens.
4.	There are two definitions for “int times”. Once on line #2 and once on line #24.
a.	Explain where each definition applies in the code
Line 2 is what the value that the int is.For line 24 it means that you are adding 1 to the blink

b.	Explain if there is any of overlap


No because it is enclosed and none of the prequiest for it to blink did not happen.
